## Project Overview

Summaryze is a web application that provides an automated text summarization service to users. The app uses the GPT-3 API to generate a summary of uploaded handouts in PDF, DOCX or TXT format. The app will be built using the Python Django framework and deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Set up the project directory and create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
- Install Django and other required packages using `pip`.
- Create a new Django project and an app within the project called "summaryze".
- Test that the development server is running correctly by running the command `python manage.py runserver`.

### Phase 2: User Interface
- Design and implement the user interface using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- Create a home page that allows users to upload their handouts. The upload form should accept files in PDF, DOCX or TXT format.
- Create a page to display the generated summary. The page should show the original document and the generated summary side by side.
- Implement basic user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system. Only authenticated users should be able to upload and view summaries.
- Add error messages for invalid input and other edge cases.

### Phase 3: Backend Development
- Write code to extract text from uploaded handouts using Python libraries like `PyPDF2` or `textract`.
- Connect to the GPT-3 API and send extracted text for summarization. You will need to create an account with OpenAI and obtain an API key for this.
- Parse the API response and extract the required number of paragraphs for the summary.
- Write code to save the generated summaries to a PostgreSQL database. You will need to set up a database and configure the connection in `settings.py`.

### Phase 4: Testing and Debugging
- Test the app for bugs and edge cases. Write unit tests using Django's built-in testing framework.
- Debug issues that arise during testing. Use debugging tools like `pdb` and `print` statements to diagnose problems.
- Get feedback from users and implement necessary changes. Use user feedback to improve the app's usability and functionality.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Prepare the app for deployment by removing debug flags and configuring production settings.
- Set up a PostgreSQL database on a cloud platform like Heroku. Use the `dj_database_url` library to parse the database URL and set the connection parameters in `settings.py`.
- Set environment variables for `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` and `GPT3_API_KEY`.
- Deploy the app to Heroku or another cloud platform. Use Git or Heroku CLI to push the code to the remote repository.
- Run final tests to ensure the app is running correctly in production.

### Phase 6: Maintenance
- Monitor the app for errors and fix any issues that arise. Set up logging to record errors and exceptions.
- Implement new features based on user feedback. Use tools like GitHub Issues and Trello to manage feature requests and bugs.
- Keep the app up-to-date with security patches and new Django releases. Check the Django security releases page regularly and update the app accordingly.

## Project Deliverables
- A functional web application that allows users to upload handouts and generates summaries using the GPT-3 API.
- A GitHub repository with all source code, documentation and configuration files.
- A ReadMe file that includes instructions for setting up and running the app, and information about the technologies used.
- Unit tests that cover critical application functionality.
- A project report that summarizes the development process, challenges faced and lessons learned.
