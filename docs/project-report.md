# Project Report: Summaryze App

## Introduction:
The Summaryze app is a web application that provides an automated text summarization service to users. The app uses the GPT-3 API to generate a summary of uploaded handouts in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format. The app is built using the Python Django framework and deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku. 

## Development Process:
The development process was divided into six phases, starting with project setup and ending with maintenance. Each phase had specific objectives and deliverables, as outlined in the project plan.

## Challenges Faced:
One of the major challenges faced during development was the GPT-3 API's response time. The API took longer than expected to generate summaries, causing delays in the app's response time. I had to optimize the code to reduce the API calls and cache responses to improve the app's performance. 

## Lessons Learned:
I learned the importance of designing an efficient architecture for the app to minimize response time.
